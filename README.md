## Game: Winterfell
Winterfell is a game inspired by Game of Thrones. 
Jon Snow (Player) is the protector of the castle. He fights the white walkers and wants to win the game. In this game, the health of castle decreases in proportion to the bullets hit. Jon collects coins to increase his score and collecting 5 coins gives him an extra shield with added abilities such as extra powered bullets. He keeps navigating around the castle until all white walkers are killed. On finishing one level, he moves to the next level. In level 2 and 3, gameplay remains same except the difficulty level increases where number of white walkers to kill increases along with the speed of their bullets. Finishing level 3 completes the game and Jon wins. Score is updated based on the number of coins collected by Jon and the number of white walkers killed by him. The player loses the game when castle's health drops down to 0.
