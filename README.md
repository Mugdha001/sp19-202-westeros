## Game: Battle of Winterfell
The game is a game inspired by the TV show Game of Thrones. 
Jon Snow (Player) is the protector of the castle. He fights the white walkers (Enemy) and wants to protect his home. In this game, the health of castle decreases in proportion to the bullets hit. Jon absorbs those bullets to protect the castle. He keeps navigating around the castle until all white walkers are killed. He fires his own bullets at the white walkers to defeat them. On finishing one level, he moves to the next level. In level 2 and 3, gameplay remains similar with the difficulty level increases where number of white walkers to kill increases along with the speed of their bullets. Finishing level 3 completes the game and Jon wins. Score is updated based on the number of bullet hits on the castle and the number of white walkers killed by the player. The player loses the game when castle's health drops down to 0.
